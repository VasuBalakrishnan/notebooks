notebooks
==========

This repo contains my explorative projects / ideas as Jupyter Notebooks

### Setup:
-----

To get started, run 
```bash
$ source ./run sh
``` 

This script creates a virtual environment, install required dependencies, and setups a jupyterlab environment with appropriate extensions. 

All shared code has been refactored into separate python module. Thanks to this [post](https://godatadriven.com/blog/write-less-terrible-code-with-jupyter-notebook/), I was able to create a local package which can then be imported within jupyter notebooks.
